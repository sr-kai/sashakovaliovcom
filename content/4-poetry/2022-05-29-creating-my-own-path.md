Creating my own path,<br>
Creating my own way,<br>
I struggle with taking a step,<br>
I struggle with guilt and shame. 

There is nowhere to run,<br>
There is nowhere to hide,<br>
I'm looking into my heart,<br>
I'm scared, I'm terrified. 

I'm breathing the sounds in,<br>
I'm shining like mighty sun,<br>
I touch what I meant to be,<br>
I'm joyful. I am one.

I'm one with expanding breath,<br>
I'm one with my friends and foes,<br>
I'm one with your gentle touch,<br>
I'm one with my own toes. 

I'm diving into myself:<br>
I'm limitless, I'm divine. <br>
I'm thankful to you. I rest<br>
Sustained by will to shine. 

To shine for them and you,<br>
To see the smile of your eyes,<br>
To gift forgiveness to all,<br>
To soften all hearts and minds. 

Accepting my own path,<br>
Embracing eternal joy,<br>
May all people learn to love,<br>
May all celebrate.<br>
Rejoice!
