In very depth, in deafening trench<br>
There lives a pure darkness. <br>
It neither sleeps nor eats, <br>
It burns within, eternal pit of sadness. 

The life around it is gray,<br>
Like distant limpy ocean. <br>
Yet thirst for knowledge <br>
Sends myself to poke unseen emotions. 

This planet guards itself, you can't<br> 
Disturb millenia of slumber.<br>
Like dragonfly, observing prey<br>
It knows myself, I'm afraid, too well --<br>
It never ever stumbles.

One touch, one glimpse, a shallow breath,<br>
Just single blink of knowing:<br>
The poison clouds are swift and thick --<br> 
I'm shrouded and bawling. 

Yet every sound arrives still-born<br>
In viscous cream of velvet,<br>
Your senses melt in quiet pace.

**"Fortissimo!"**

**"Allegro!"**

Conductor once, I'm tied and cast<br>
In golden brown ember.<br>
Abundant fear Deimos casts<br>
And Dread commands:

**"Surrender!"**

My light goes off.

It's off.

Again.

The chapter's blank.

I glimpse --

The pages turn!

The march goes on.

But I can't even dream. 

Can't dream of thrilling new frontiers,<br>
Can't dream of palettes or fresh sounds.<br>
Can't sit or rest, can't be, can't taste.<br>
I want to end this malice! 

The battle has been fought and lost<br>
Who knows how many times.<br>
What if surrender is the key<br>
To claw through dark confines?

Like obliuette that slowly rots<br>
The soul in deadly horror,<br>
The inescapable it seems<br>
Is my wish to explore.

Things never last, not even suns,<br>
They die in blazing light,<br>
One day I will succeed, I know.<br>
Alas, it's not tonight.
