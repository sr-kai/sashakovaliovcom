Put your hands, callous and hard<br>
Into calm embrace of my gentle heart.<br>
Heart once beaten to pulp by their fears and pain,

You uplifted me high.<br>

🌤️🌤️🌤️ <br>

In the sky.<br>

Say my name!<br>

Say my name every day when you smile and you breathe,<br>
Say my name every day when you feel sunny breeze,<br>
Say my name every day when nothing goes right,<br>
Say my name even when it's a cold rainy night.

Show my name to your mom,<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;to your friends,<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;to the world.

Write it down in your dreams,<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;on your skin,<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;in your phone.

Sing my name to the birds,<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;to the trees,<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;to us all.

Let the love that you are light the path.

I'm home.
