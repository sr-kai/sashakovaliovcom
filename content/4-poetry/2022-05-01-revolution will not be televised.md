Revolution will not be televised, <br>
Revolution will be nullified.<br>
By the state, by the feed, by establishment,<br>
While you sleep soothed by grim lullaby.

They chose idols of ancient origin,<br>
It's not hidden -- they are glorified.<br>
Have you had enough? Are you strong and kind <br>
To embrace the pain of sight?

Wipe slate clean of your digital double?<br>
Cut the tether of shiny black brick? <br>
Open doors of your heart to all brothers? <br>
Help them rise, heal all wounds, hear them speak?

Revolution will not be televised,<br>
Revolution will be liked/disliked.<br> 
By your friend, by your kids, by the algorithm,<br>
While you bathe in warm glow made of lies. 

Summon Pythia living in plastic box,<br>
She has answers is that what you seek?<br>
I don't like, I don't star, I don't post no more.<br>
Asking questions is my new motif.
