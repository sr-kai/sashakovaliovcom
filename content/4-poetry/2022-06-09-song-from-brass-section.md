I want to tell you, how easy it can be:<br>
To be myself with you, to see you smile.<br>
To hold and dance, to laugh and be<br>
Just calmly laying close, relaxed and quiet. 

I want to touch, taste, hear, bask<br>
With you in magic we design:<br>
It flows like melodies of flutes we listened to one time. 

The softness of your tender heart,<br>
Your spirit, your divine...<br>
I'm awed at how you flow in rhythm<br>
Most people beg to find.

How you create, observe and share,<br>
Your raw unaltered real true story.<br>
How I see you in me, <br>
us, <br>
he, <br>
we, <br>
them.

Wish we could dream all night in bright, brisk, fresh inhale of shared glory.
