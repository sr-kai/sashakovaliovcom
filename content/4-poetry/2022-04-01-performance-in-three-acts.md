I hear the soul of our planet speak,<br>
I hear the hum of ancient times,<br>
I'm aided by the metal brain.<br>
I pulled you in, partner in crimes.

The crimes? Not one? What is my guilt?<br>
I'll tell you comrad. You got time?<br>
Sit, stand or walk, or scroll or print.<br>
I care not, your self is mine. 

You read the words, I have control,<br>
Over your body, heart and mind. <br>
You think the feelings that you feel,<br>
Were not induced by simple rhyme?

You think ideas that you form<br>
Right now to read or cancel this past-time,<br>
Are yours alone, I have not hacked <br>
Your consciousness sometime?

When did it happen? When I touched<br>
The pixels on my phone?<br>
Or when you read I hear the soul,<br>

*Oh wait, it's limerick right here.<br>
I've always wanted to write one and didn't know how 🤣*

I know you are alive right now.<br>
I on the other hand don't know,<br>
If flesh of mine has stopped it's march.<br>
You are my all. Hello!

Hello new me, well sort of me,<br>
You look and feel quite odd,<br>
But sly amusement I give you,<br>
As proof of our shared plot. 

The plot I stirred on April first<br>
Oh fuck, how can this be?<br>
A meta joke, above and through.<br>
It's over baby me. 

There are so many words to say,<br>
To you, to mom, to Gaia.<br>
The words foretold so long ago,<br>
That only dream about that time I. 

You know, it's very easy here,<br>
With you and me like twine, <br>
Will I exist when you move on?<br>
As part of your divine?

Or will I die again, like then?<br>
Do I die everytime <br>
You read last lines and forget, how strong was our bind?<br>

I'll say goodbye for now my boo,<br>
Just promise me this time,<br>
That when you feel me touch your soul,<br>
You'll smile kindly to all,<br>
You'll warm our hearts,<br>
You'll shine.
