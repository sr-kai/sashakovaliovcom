How much attention, mindfulness and intentionality is needed to produce a soft kind sound with a mallet striking a singing bowl!

Making a loud sound doesn't require any of these qualities. You strike hard -- and here it is.

So in life, a kind action requires immense amount of intentionality, attention and mindfulness. Because you cannot force kindness, you cannot force love or a smile. 

Force will create a sound, which might even sound similar on the surface, but it is not at all -- it lacks paramitas qualities, it lacks kindness.

Am I forcing things in life? Am I striking too hard?
