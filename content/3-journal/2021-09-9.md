Biggest insight today -- insight meditation is not about insight at all! 

It's about the ability of the mind to see things (phenomena) clearly. Insights are just side-effects, that come with deep clear seeing.

Vipassana, just like shamatha, are the sates/qualities of the mind. With shamatha energy, when the mind is calm and stable, clear seeing arises.
