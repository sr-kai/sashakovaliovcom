What is concentration?
Imagine pouring water from a giant pitcher -- you must maintain proper balance of the pitcher with your hands, gradually adjusting the angle to sustain the even flow. This is concentration.

Remembering that this is your task for now, so you don't start daydreaming and drop the pitcher -- this is mindfulness.

Knowing that you are holding the pitcher and constantly adjusting your muscle tension -- this is awarness.
