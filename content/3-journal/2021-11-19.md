The gift of meditation is freedom (liberation) from the ultimate oppressor – your own intellect.

Just by touching the true nature of our heart-minds for a little bit, seeing the world for what it actually is changes our perception. 

It's like a breath of fresh air after you've been stuck in a smelly room for hours. You don't even know anymore you've been breathing foul air because your body has adapted and got used to it. But the moment your breathe the clean, vibrant, fresh air in – there is no doubt that this is how it should be, that it is pure.
