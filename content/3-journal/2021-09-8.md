The vividness of clarity!

It's like being on the mountain top -- brisk, energized, serene, calm and ready! Wowz 😄

Where does this habit (desire) to come back to samsara is coming from? This incessant need to be doing something? And doing exactly what? Being unhappy? Working on things that do not align with our values?

Aaaaah! The raft! The raft is still very much needed. I can see how eventually it will no longer be needed at all.

Rejoicing 🤗
