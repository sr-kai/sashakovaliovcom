Different teachings are just like different maps -- all lead to the same destination. Some are very detailed, and some are just like a topography maps, shot from high above. 

**I** am the one who chooses the map and the guide. **I** am responsible for recognizing what works for me, and what causes more agitation of the mind.

Cultivate trust in my own wisdom, my intuition.
