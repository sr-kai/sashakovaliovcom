What a sit!

So much tenderness and calm, joy and kindness. Also curiosity.

In the beginning there was a pocket of anxiety in my belly -- it didn't want to give away control. It was afraid of being vulnerable. But you cannot be open without being vulnerable. Openness brings such tremendous calm, equanimity and acceptance! Not a single wall can muster such strength!

Samsara calls over and over, but I want to stay here with tender joy and kindness. How do I integrate everything? How would I know it's been integrated? Is it intentional and deliberate actions being carried out mindfully at all times? How can I get to this place?

I'm allowing the body to express itself somatically -- it wants to move -- let it move; it wants to growl -- let it growl. So much awareness today!
