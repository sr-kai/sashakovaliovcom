Analytical meditation, metta, bodhicitta, mantras – they are all like remedies for the mind.
They nourish and cleanse it, in a way rewiring the default mode network.

There is an immediate effect you can feel during the meditation, and a more prolonged one that affect daily life and future sits. That is why they are just as important as the concentration practices. 

There is indeed no giver and no receiver, as there is nothing to give, nothing to receive. But because we are in samsara we do practice free giving and free receiving, to cultivate heart-mind qualities. 

Continuous placement is very evident – the patched mindfulness become replaced with the flowing one, there are no interruptions. How do I sustain it for longer? What causes it to crumble?
