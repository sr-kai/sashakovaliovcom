There is indeed a big difference between subjective (metta, bodhicitta) and objective meditation.

**Subjective**
We generate the object for the mind and keep being mindful about it.

**Objective**
We study what is here – emptiness and impermanence.

Delighted concentration! Keep checking the energy of concentration – is it pushing too far? Is it too tight? The best way to loosen it without going into laxity/lethargy is to change the energy behind concentration.

What do we do with the lights appearing? Focus on them instead of breath? Or continue on the primary object?
