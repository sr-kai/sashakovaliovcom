There is such a big difference between being and doing.

Being has this unobstructed flow, which is calm and kind, with very uplifting energy. Doing – even just a tiny thing – interrupts the natural flow.

Can a person just be without doing? 

I do not think so. But can a person do things with a less of a striving energy, less mindless destructive actions and instead bring the energy of being into their life?

It seems if we follow bodhicitta, our heart-mind, then doing is transformed into being: our actions match our spirit, and the universal design. We create less friction with the surrounding reality, because we become (or rather come back) united with it.

Is my mindfulness part of the shared cosmic consciousness? Is every one of us carrying a divine spark? This seems to be the only way.
