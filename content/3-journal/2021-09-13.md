Awarness is like gentle hands that cup concentration in its protection.

It is like a vehicle upon which concentration rides. Without kind shelter of awareness, habits arise and concentration is lost.

Strengthening mindfulness is key. Without it we are bling, not knowing what is happening at any present moment. How would you know you have equanimity if you are not even aware it's arising?

Attention can go to any object it wants. With concentration we tie the mind to an object of attention. But the work is not done. We gaze at the mind: gently, but firmly tied to the object. Thoughts, feelings, emotions, senses will keep happening, and let the happen, do not try to pacify them -- in doing so distraction has overtaken the mind, and awarness is likely gone.
