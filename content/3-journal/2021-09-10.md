The difference of suffering and not is immense! It's like being thrown into stale, dirty, poisonous water!

Your whole being: body and mind start suffocating. Why choose living here?

Joy, calm, clarity are so different. Place of endless rest. It's elusive for now, but it's here.

Attain liberation! Attain full awakening!
