Retreat.

How calm and gentle samadhi is.
The mind is so still, so pure.
The pre-born world free of concepts, desires, needs - is soothing, nurturing, blissful.
I'm thankful for my attainments, for a glimpse into what is available to humans.
I called upon the global sangha for help – and it was wise and wonderful.
How freely I breathe the gently joy, how I wish for everyone to experience it.
