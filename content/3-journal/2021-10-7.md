Mind is such a worker! 😄 Not a moment for it to just be. It plots and hides behind virtuous thoughts, observations – it wants to constantly **be doing** something. That "something" it is very familiar with – habits, worries, analyzing – whatever your patterns are.

So it is such joy, such rest for the mind to just relax and let be. I wish everyone would experience it 💛
