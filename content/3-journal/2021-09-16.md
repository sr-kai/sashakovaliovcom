I guess the real work beings now 😁

Clarity, mindfulness and vigilance mature -- it seems now I'm really observing what is happening with certain vigor of the mind.

The more stable the concentration is on the object -- the less effort you need to actually generate.

Saw what effort is. Energy? Hard to put into words. 

When the mind is vibrant and with clarity, you can actually choose your object with such a precision that the excitement coming from sense doors diminish greatly!

Use pain as an object! It has all the qualities of a good object -- very vivid, very familiar. Can I integrate it? 

So brisk!
