Final retreat meditation.

What a wonderful sit! Just as I was sitting outside meditating at the gazebo, two deer show up – a mother and a child. They were so tender, so gentle, exploring, so beautiful.

Out of emptiness we create everything. The power of creating is so powerful! Maybe that's why we got so addicted to it?

Once created, whatever that is, must be maintained through effort and energy. Otherwise it just collapses into emptiness once again. Nothing stays forever – impermanence is of our creations – not of emptiness.

If only we could just give up making things up, directing, fighting, resisting! This is what meditation is about – letting go, layer by layer, of desires, grasping, chasing, thoughts and senses. Once that is done the truth reveals itself.
