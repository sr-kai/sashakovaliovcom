Patience is everywhere, it's inseparable from wisdom.

Just like it will take time for a sound to completely dissipate into silence, so does every process take its time.

Patience is knowing the reality and accepting it. In fact, I'm quite sure there is no "patience" -- it's yet another reminder to cultivate acceptance, to embrace life, to not fight it and force it, but to use it.

Who creates impatience? The mind 😛

How? Forcing, hoping, fearing, desiring.

Why? A force of habit.

When? Almost every moment.

Remedy? Mindfulness, kindness, wisdom, practice, acceptance.
