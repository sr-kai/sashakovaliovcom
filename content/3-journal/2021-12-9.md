You know all these apps and productivity and happiness journals are always asking: name three things you are grateful for.

How can I name three things, when the whole world is gratitude? Do these questions lead to more separation? Or do they nudge the mind to break negativity bias? Is there a better way to ask gratitude question? 

Thinking about the questions and laughing 😄
