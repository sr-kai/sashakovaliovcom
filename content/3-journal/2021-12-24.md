Where do _I_ start? Or end?

Observing emptiness -- how can I even describe this perfect stillness -- yet it flows and moves. The mind picks up the strands of it and gets busy creating stuff. Out of nothing. 

I/we/universe are one and inseparable.

You disappear completely, as if the mind of the universe if lowing right through you. You finally join in and become the rain, the river, the crow. It's not scary, because there is no fear. There is _no one to be afraid_.

Vast and open, in harmony.

Seeing how the mind created tiny obstacles on the way to anything. So silly 😄

There is more to emptiness -- it's not nothing! It is ready to become absolutely everything at any moment.

Why does it feel good and right to create bodhicitta or metta? And _not_ anger or depression? 

One is limitless, another one limited.
