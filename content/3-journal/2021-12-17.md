How can I describe what an open heart feels like?

Serenity with a soft feeling of gentle teddy bear 🧸. The smell of mom in the early morning, before I was leaving on another journey.

Open heart can hold tears, sadness, regret, guilt without them imprinting on your being.

Once you discover it in yourself, you want to give it to others. You see it everywhere -- in your own touch, in holding a book, looking at a flower.

What's interesting, not all objects seem to have this quality or maybe I can't see it fully yet? TV, shelves, sofa -- are just things. Plants though seem to be alive.
