After 10 years doing tech marketing, getting burnt out and being stressed the fuck out and unhappy most of the time I had a revelation. Well a sort of revelation – my doctor called it a panic attack 😫. She also prescribed some pills. But instead, I threw them out, and signed up for a meditation class.

And it changed everything. 

Now I teach meditation. I’m working on making it open and accessible to as many people as possible. Check out https://justmeditate.com, a simple web app without login and paywalls, without cookies or tracking of any kind. It’s open-source and free. There are no installs and no downloads. It will probably work on your fridge or TV. It’s a new kind of marketing, more humane and giving.

If you think your company can benefit from meditation – it can! I bet you are looking for case studies and pitch decks. That’s not the way. Your company and your employees are unique. But what unites us all, is that we want to feel connected and valued, calm and happy, motivated and supported. And guess what? That’s proven to be good for business.

I love teaching mindfulness to everyone, and especially to folks who work in tech. It takes courage, understanding and determination to introduce a mindfulness program into a workspace. [Let’s talk about how we can do it for you and for your co-workers.](https://sashakovaliov.com/contact/)
